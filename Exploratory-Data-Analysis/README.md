Exploratory Data Analysis using R for Udacity's Nanodegree

This project explains the Exploratory Data Analysis techniques that could be used for understanding relationships between variables using 
graphs and plots. The dataset used here is a <a href = https://github.com/baidrahul9/DAN-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/wineQualityReds.csv>Red Wine</a> dataset and the analysis is done using R. The <a href = https://github.com/baidrahul9/DAN-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Final_Project.pdf>Knitted Version</a>
explains the dataset like a story and <a href = https://github.com/baidrahul9/Udacity-Nanodegree/blob/master/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/Final%20Project.Rmd> the Rmd file </a> contains the code. Enjoy!
