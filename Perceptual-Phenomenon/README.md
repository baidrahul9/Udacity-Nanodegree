# DAN-Testing Perceptual Phenomenon
This project was built for statistically testing the Stroop effect. 
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. 
The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. 
In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. 
In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. 
In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. 
Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
